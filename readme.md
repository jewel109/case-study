Background: A payroll system calculates salaries for different employee types. A general Employee class calculates salary based on hours worked, while ContractEmployee (a derived class) might have a different payment calculation, like a fixed contract rate. The payroll system processes all employee types and expects consistent results.


Question: How would you design the Employee and ContractEmployee classes to ensure the payroll system handles both without needing special conditions?
